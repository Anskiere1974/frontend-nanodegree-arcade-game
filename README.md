# Frogger Arcade Game
## Overview

Frogger is an adaption from the 1981 Sega classic arcade game. This version is part of the Udacity Front End Development curriculum.

The student is provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools he must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

#### Why this project?

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

The student will learn JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. He will discover a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.

## Installation

## How to play

Our hero starts in the grass on the bottom. He has to cross the streets - avoiding all those nasty bugs - to reach the lovely princess. You can move by using the up, down, left and right arrow buttons. If you collide with a bug, you will lose a life. If you have zero lives you will lose the game. Everytime you reach the princess you score one point. If you get five points, you win and the lovely princess will be your prom date.
